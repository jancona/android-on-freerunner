= Introduction =

This page is under the major construction.
Please refer to a Deviant Art page for this project [http://androidonfreerunner.deviantart.com/] for some graphics. The reason why DeviantArt was used as a graphics storage was to attract the viewers and possible artists who would like to contribute to this project. 

Currently, there are 4 categories used on a Deviant Art page
-Blueprints
-Finals
-WallPapers
-Misc

*Blueprints are the rough ideas and drawings that someone may like to use and enhance with the textures and so on. All blueprints are 3 color blueprints, having the Android's logo colors:

(blue) R:48 G:88 B:124
(green) R:151 G:192 B:61
(white) R:255 G:255 B:255

*Finals are the blueprints turned into a final image, with textures, shadows, and so on

*WallPapers are the wallpapers that users may use for their mobile devices

*Misc (self-explanatory)
